<p>Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model. Any time you have sections of UI that update dynamically (e.g., changing depending on the user&#39;s actions or when an external data source changes), KO can help you implement it more simply and maintainably.</p>
<p>Headline features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elegant dependency tracking</strong> - automatically updates the right parts of your UI whenever your data model changes.</li>
<li><strong>Declarative bindings</strong> - a simple and obvious way to connect parts of your UI to your data model. You can construct a complex dynamic UIs easily using arbitrarily nested binding contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Trivially extensible</strong> - implement custom behaviors as new declarative bindings for easy reuse in just a few lines of code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pure JavaScript library</strong> - works with any server or client-side technology</li>
<li><strong>Can be added on top of your existing web application</strong> without requiring major architectural changes</li>
<li><strong>Compact</strong> - around 13kb after gzipping</li>
<li><strong>Works on any mainstream browser</strong> (IE 6+, Firefox 2+, Chrome, Safari, others)</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive suite of specifications</strong> (developed BDD-style) means its correct functioning can easily be verified on new browsers and platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers familiar with Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, or other MV* technologies may see MVVM as a real-time form of MVC with declarative syntax. In another sense, you can think of KO as a general way to make UIs for editing JSON data... whatever works for you :)</p>
<h2 id="ok-how-do-you-use-it-">OK, how do you use it?</h2>
<p>The quickest and most fun way to get started is by working through the <a href="http://learn.knockoutjs.com">interactive tutorials</a>. Once you&#39;ve got to grips with the basics, explore the <a href="../examples/index.html">live examples</a> and then have a go with it in your own project.</p>
<h2 id="is-ko-intended-to-compete-with-jquery-or-prototype-etc-or-work-with-it-">Is KO intended to compete with jQuery (or Prototype, etc.) or work with it?</h2>
<p>Everyone loves jQuery! It&#39;s an outstanding replacement for the clunky, inconsistent DOM API we had to put up with in the past. jQuery is an excellent low-level way to manipulate elements and event handlers in a web page. KO solves a different problem.</p>
<p>As soon as your UI gets nontrivial and has a few overlapping behaviors, things can get tricky and expensive to maintain if you only use jQuery. Consider an example: you&#39;re displaying a list of items, stating the number of items in that list, and want to enable an &#39;Add&#39; button only when there are fewer than 5 items. jQuery doesn&#39;t have a concept of an underlying data model, so to get the number of items you have to infer it from the number of TRs in a table or the number of DIVs with a certain CSS class. Maybe the number of items is displayed in some SPAN, and you have to remember to update that SPAN&#39;s text when the user adds an item. You also must remember to disable the &#39;Add&#39; button when the number of TRs is 5. Later, you&#39;re asked also to implement a &#39;Delete&#39; button and you have to figure out which DOM elements to change whenever it&#39;s clicked.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-knockout-different-">How is Knockout different?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s much easier with KO. It lets you scale up in complexity without fear of introducing inconsistencies. Just represent your items as a JavaScript array, and then use a <code>foreach</code> binding to transform this array into a TABLE or set of DIVs. Whenever the array changes, the UI changes to match (you don&#39;t have to figure out how to inject new TRs or where to inject them). The rest of the UI stays in sync. For example, you can declaratively bind a SPAN to display the number of items as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div data-bind='highlight: "html"'>There are &lt;span data-bind="text: myItems().count">&lt;/span> items</div>
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it! You don&#39;t have to write code to update it; it updates on its own when the <code>myItems</code> array changes. Similarly, to make the &#39;Add&#39; button enable or disable depending on the number of items, just write:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div data-bind='highlight: "html"'>&lt;button data-bind="enable: myItems().count &lt; 5">Add&lt;/button></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Later, when you&#39;re asked to implement the &#39;Delete&#39; functionality, you don&#39;t have to figure out what bits of the UI it has to interact with; you just make it alter the underlying data model.</p>
<p>To summarise: KO doesn&#39;t compete with jQuery or similar low-level DOM APIs. KO provides a complementary, high-level way to link a data model to a UI. KO itself doesn&#39;t depend on jQuery, but you can certainly use jQuery at the same time, and indeed that&#39;s often useful if you want things like animated transitions.</p>
